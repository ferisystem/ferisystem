### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  
I'm a Python developer focused on building smart backend systems and automation tools.

I specialize in creating bots and infrastructures for financial markets â€” especially in the context of high-frequency and platform-integrated automation. My work includes managing production-level projects for multiple crypto and FX exchanges, delivering robust solutions that handle real-world trading flows.

I also work with Django, FastAPI, Redis, and automation tools like Selenium, MQL4, MQL5 and Telethon/Aiogram.  
If itâ€™s repetitive, I probably already wrote a bot to handle it.
